# Pacman Clone

# Introduction

- Based off of the classic arcade video game designed and created by Toru Iwatani, this project was designed and implemented in C++ using the Simple DirectMedia Layer API. The purpose of this project was to explore the use of this API in designing and rendering a pacman clone. To stay true to the original, this clone contains all the features, including scoring, ghost movement, and frame-rates of entities (i.e. the pacman and the ghost);
